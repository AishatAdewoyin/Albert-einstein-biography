## How I should improve this:
   -  I am very keen on improving this project using react and tailwind, which I was using up until I ran into errors due to some deprecated dependencies that came with my react installation.
   - I had little time to submit the project, so I had to use what is available
   - I will like to add some auths to it
   - also improve it by using some available technologies to store books or for users to be able to create a library of there own where the can store and retrieve books
